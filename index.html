      <h1> About Taylor Swift</h1>
      <div class="line">
      </div>
    <p>Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. 
      <br>Her discography spans genres and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.
        Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, and released her eponymous debut studio album in 2006.

She explored country pop on her second and third studio albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010). The success of the former's singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio established Swift as a leading crossover artist. She experimented further with pop, rock, and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012). Her fifth, the synth-pop album 1989 (2014), effectively transformed her status from country songstress to pop star, supported by the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny on her personal life that followed largely inspired Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation (2017), which delved into urban sounds.</p>
